Although the master mainline branch for this material is in the Groovy Subversion repository
(https://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/trunk/groovy/ide/emacs), Bazaar is used for development -- the directory in
Subversion holds a Bazaar branch so that it is a peer to the feature branches using bzr-svn.  Feature
branches are held on Launchpad, the project is at https://launchpad.net/groovy-emacs-mode.
